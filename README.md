# 1brc-cpp
Playing around with the [one billion row challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) in C++.

Note, none of the code in this repo should be considered good code. It takes a lot of shortcuts to try to be as fast as possible. And even then, you could probably make it a lot faster than this, but this is as far as I got this time. Fun challenge!

Command used to compile (on Windows) is:
```
cl /W4 /O2 /EHsc /Zi /std:c++20 main.cpp
```
